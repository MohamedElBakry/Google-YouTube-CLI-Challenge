# Google-YouTube-CLI-Challenge
Submission for Google's YouTube CLI challenge.

For the Bright Network Intenship Experience UK we had to choose a challenge, and I chose to tackle Google's challenge.

This challenge comprised of:
* Developing a YouTube CLI (command-line interface) project, which entailed replicating and simulating YouTube's features.

And consequently:
* This challenged and therefore improved my coding skills to make the project be maintainable, easily readable, and have DRY principles.
